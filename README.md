## 🧠 Overview

**PromptShield** is an advanced AI security framework that protects large language models (LLMs) from prompt injection, manipulation, and jailbreak attempts.  
It uses multi-layered detection, semantic pattern analysis, and adaptive machine learning to identify malicious or deceptive prompts in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-layer detection system** (Pattern, Semantic, Encoding, Behavioral)  
- **Massive attack signature database** with adaptive pattern learning  
- **Context-aware analysis** using conversation history  
- **Real-time protection** (<100ms average detection time)  
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, Termux, and Windows  
- **API-ready** via FastAPI or standalone CLI  
- **SDK Integration** for developers to easily embed PromptShield in their apps  
- **Automatic rule updates** to maintain current protection coverage
